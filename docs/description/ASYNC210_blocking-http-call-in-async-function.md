# blocking-http-call-in-async-function (ASYNC210)
Derived from the flake8-async linter.
## What it does
Checks that async functions do not contain blocking HTTP calls.
## Why is this bad?
Blocking an async function via a blocking HTTP call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
HTTP response, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.
Instead of making a blocking HTTP call, use an asynchronous HTTP client
library such as aiohttp or httpx.
## Example
```
async def fetch():
    urllib.request.urlopen("https://example.com/foo/bar").read()
```
## Use instead:
```
async def fetch():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://example.com/foo/bar") as resp:
            ...
```
