# no-slots-in-tuple-subclass (SLOT001)
Derived from the flake8-slots linter.
## What it does
Checks for subclasses of tuple that lack a __slots__ definition.
## Why is this bad?
In Python, the __slots__ attribute allows you to explicitly define the
attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python
uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory
overhead. However, when __slots__ is defined, Python uses a more compact
internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory
savings.
Subclasses of tuple inherit all the attributes and methods of the
built-in tuple class. Since tuples are typically immutable, they don't
require additional attributes beyond what the tuple class provides.
Defining __slots__ for subclasses of tuple prevents the creation of a
dictionary for each instance, reducing memory consumption.
## Example
```
class Foo(tuple):
    pass
```
## Use instead:
```
class Foo(tuple):
    __slots__ = ()
```
