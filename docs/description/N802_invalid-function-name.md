# invalid-function-name (N802)
Derived from the pep8-naming linter.
## What it does
Checks for functions names that do not follow the snake_case naming
convention.
## Why is this bad?
PEP 8 recommends that function names follow snake_case:
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to
improve readability. mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where thatâ€™s already the
prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.
Names can be excluded from this rule using the lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names
or lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names configuration options. For example,
to ignore all functions starting with test_ from this rule, set the
lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names option to ["test_*"].
## Example
```
def myFunction():
    pass
```
## Use instead:
```
def my_function():
    pass
```
