# wait-for-process-in-async-function (ASYNC222)
Derived from the flake8-async linter.
## What it does
Checks that async functions do not wait on processes with blocking methods.
## Why is this bad?
Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.
Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library
or function, like trio.to_thread.run_sync()
or anyio.to_thread.run_sync().
## Example
```
async def foo():
    os.waitpid(0)
```
## Use instead:
```
def wait_for_process():
    os.waitpid(0)
async def foo():
    await asyncio.loop.run_in_executor(None, wait_for_process)
```
