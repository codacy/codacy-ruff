# unrecognized-platform-name (PYI008)
Derived from the flake8-pyi linter.
## What it does
Check for unrecognized platform names in sys.platform checks.
Note: this rule is only enabled in .pyi stub files.
## Why is this bad?
If a sys.platform check compares to a platform name outside of a
small set of known platforms (e.g. "linux", "win32", etc.), it's likely
a typo or a platform name that is not recognized by type checkers.
The list of known platforms is: "linux", "win32", "cygwin", "darwin".
## Example
```
if sys.platform == "linus": ...
```
## Use instead:
```
if sys.platform == "linux": ...
```
