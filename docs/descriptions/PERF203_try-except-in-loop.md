# try-except-in-loop (PERF203)
Derived from the Perflint linter.
## What it does
Checks for uses of except handling via try-except within for and
while loops.
## Why is this bad?
Exception handling via try-except blocks incurs some performance
overhead, regardless of whether an exception is raised.
To optimize your code, two techniques are possible:
Refactor your code to put the entire loop into the try-except block,
    rather than wrapping each iteration in a separate try-except block.
Use "Look Before You Leap" idioms that attempt to avoid exceptions
    being raised in the first place, avoiding the need to use try-except
    blocks in the first place.
This rule is only enforced for Python versions prior to 3.11, which
introduced "zero-cost" exception handling. However, note that even on
Python 3.11 and newer, refactoring your code to avoid exception handling in
tight loops can provide a significant speedup in some cases, as zero-cost
exception handling is only zero-cost in the "happy path" where no exception
is raised in the try-except block.
As with all perflint rules, this is only intended as a
micro-optimization. In many cases, it will have a negligible impact on
performance.
## Example
```
string_numbers: list[str] = ["1", "2", "three", "4", "5"]
# `try`/`except` that could be moved out of the loop:
int_numbers: list[int] = []
for num in string_numbers:
    try:
        int_numbers.append(int(num))
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Couldn't convert to integer: {e}")
        break
# `try`/`except` used when "look before you leap" idioms could be used:
number_names: dict[int, str] = {1: "one", 3: "three", 4: "four"}
for number in range(5):
    try:
        name = number_names[number]
    except KeyError:
        continue
    else:
        print(f"The name of {number} is {name}")
```
## Use instead:
```
string_numbers: list[str] = ["1", "2", "three", "4", "5"]
int_numbers: list[int] = []
try:
    for num in string_numbers:
        int_numbers.append(int(num))
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Couldn't convert to integer: {e}")
number_names: dict[int, str] = {1: "one", 3: "three", 4: "four"}
for number in range(5):
    name = number_names.get(number)
    if name is not None:
        print(f"The name of {number} is {name}")
```
