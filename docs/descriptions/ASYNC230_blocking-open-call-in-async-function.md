# blocking-open-call-in-async-function (ASYNC230)
Derived from the flake8-async linter.
## What it does
Checks that async functions do not open files with blocking methods like open.
## Why is this bad?
Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.
Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library
or function.
## Example
```
async def foo():
    with open("bar.txt") as f:
        contents = f.read()
```
## Use instead:
```
import anyio
async def foo():
    async with await anyio.open_file("bar.txt") as f:
        contents = await f.read()
```
