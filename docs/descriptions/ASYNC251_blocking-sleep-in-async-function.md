# blocking-sleep-in-async-function (ASYNC251)
Derived from the flake8-async linter.
## What it does
Checks that async functions do not call time.sleep.
## Why is this bad?
Blocking an async function via a time.sleep call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
time.sleep, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.
Instead of time.sleep, use asyncio.sleep.
## Example
```
async def fetch():
    time.sleep(1)
```
## Use instead:
```
async def fetch():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```
