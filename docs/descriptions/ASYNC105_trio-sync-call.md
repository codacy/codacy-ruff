# trio-sync-call (ASYNC105)
Derived from the flake8-async linter.
Fix is sometimes available.
## What it does
Checks for calls to trio functions that are not immediately awaited.
## Why is this bad?
Many of the functions exposed by trio are asynchronous, and must be awaited
to take effect. Calling a trio function without an await can lead to
RuntimeWarning diagnostics and unexpected behaviour.
## Example
```
async def double_sleep(x):
    trio.sleep(2 * x)
```
## Use instead:
```
async def double_sleep(x):
    await trio.sleep(2 * x)
Fix safety
This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as adding an await to a function
call changes its semantics and runtime behavior.
